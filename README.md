## Testing
I conducted the testings on my project as an end-user. As this project is mainly made up of HTML and CSS, I have to do the testing manually. 

* Testing on responsiveness: I tested on responsiveness of my website by using different screensize, mainly the most popular screen sizes such as laptop, iPad and iPhone, to make sure the responsiveness of the websites staying in place when the screen size is being adjusted. 

* I tested the items in the dropdown list in my 'Submit Order' form.
  
* I tested all the buttons in my webpage to make sure they are clickable
  
* For buttons and contact form, their interaction will be fully actualized later, when I learnt Javascript. I will make them fully working.
